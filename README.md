# ExploderMan

ExploderMan is a bomberman clone. bomberman is a grid based game where the player places bombs to remove detestable to find the end of the level. I have not finished the whole game but i created a level generater and bombs that the player can place to destory walls.

# Level Blueprint
The link below shows how I procedurally created the levels in this bomber man clone I was working on.

This blueprint was created in unreal engine 4 in version 4.10. This blueprint procedurally generates a level with non detestable, and detestable blocks, enemy spawns, and player spawns.  The destructible blocks are spawned randomly.
