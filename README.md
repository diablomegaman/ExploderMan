# Example Blueprint
The link below shows how I procedurally created the levels in this bomber man clone I was working on.

This blueprint was created in unreal engine 4 in version 4.10. This blueprint procedurally generates a level with non detestable, and detestable blocks, enemy spawns, and player spawns.  The destructible blocks are spawned randomly.
